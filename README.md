Maze Algorithm/Solver in Java

Commands:
  - maze <create/solve> <maze height> <maze width>

Notes:
  - Unless your monitor is really big, try not to generate mazes larger than 20 x 20 as the window is too big to show the maze. Can scale the UI based on maze size, but not that useful as there are limits to pixel sizes.
